# CodeAlpha_Phishing_Awarness_Training

# The first intern task with CodeAlpha involved preparing an intern training presentation on ‘phishing,’ which you appropriately planned and presented to enable others to learn how to avoid such tricks. To accomplish the task, research was conducted, information was sourced and arranged logically, divided into segments, and finally, it was designed in a manner understandable to the audience.

# How the Task Was Done
# 1. Research and Content Gathering: This research involves cybersecurity guides, case experiences of phishing cons, and other business security standards.
# 2. Structuring the Content: The information was divided into logical sections to avoid any disruption of flow. Each section was devoted to a particular subject, considering the initial knowledge of phishing and the ways of protection.
# 3. Visual and Textual Design: The slides included: They are short bullet points for easy understanding of important points, Subheadings to use headings that reflect the key points of the document, Symbols that support the central message – icons, security indicators, etc.
# 4. Uploading and Sharing: Once the presentation was done, the work created was pushed to the GitHub repository to demonstrate it and then shared with multiple connections on LinkedIn to create awareness and showcase the skills.

# What Others Would Learn from It
# 1. Understanding Phishing: The target audience should be able to learn what phishing is, understand how attackers operate, and understand the attack's implications for users and organizations.
# 2. Recognizing Phishing Attempts: This section offers engaging, honest, skillful advice on distinguishing a phishing email or website: use your cursor to hover over the link, be careful with the messages with generic greetings, no typos in the URL, and no infringement on rationality.
# 3. Attackers’ Strategies: The presentation describes the techniques used by the attackers, including urgency, fear, and trust building, thus making the audience conscious of such tricks.
# 4. Prevention Techniques: They will be introduced to measures that help them be safe, such as enabling 2fa, updating software, and using antiphishing tools.
# 5. Organizational Measures: During the presentation, the author addresses measures that can be taken to safeguard against phishing attacks, such as making employees aware, setting up email filters, and having a sound incident response plan.
# 6. Learning from Real Incidents: Examples of some widely known phishing incidents exemplify the risks of downloading these emails and promote further awareness about this type of attack.
